# Overview

This is the repository, which represents a simple 2D graphics framework.
It is a library, which is simple, light and small, without any other dependecnies.
Not powerful as Unity or similar, but still enough to build old school 2D games.
It works on low level by painting pixels, lines, cyrcles, bitmaps/images and filling shapes with color.
Also it handles camera view and other necessary and important features.

For example, we have use it at Metatrans Apps in th edevelopemnt of thease 2D games:
